Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing,developing,testing and maintaining software.
It is important in the technology industry since it ensures software quality,reliability and enables scalability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early computing-The first electronic computers were developed and programming was done manually using machine code
Birth of software engineering-The term "software engineering" was introuced at the NATO software engineering conference to address the growing complexity of software.
Software crisis and methodology-New methodologies emerged, including spiral mode and incremetal development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-Define project goals,scope and fessibility.
Design-Define software architecture,system components and user interfaces.
Implementation-Convert design into actual software through coding.
Testing-Ensure the software is bug-free and meets requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology approach is linear while agile methodology has iterative approach.
Waterfall methodology would be appropriate in government and military projects,medical and pharmaceutical software.
Agile methodology is suitable for mobile app development and game development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-codes and maintains software applications.
Quality assurance engineer-creates and executes test plans to check software functionality.
Project manager-oversees the software development process,ensuring the project is completed on time,within budget and meets requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE provides intelligent code completion, syntax highlighting and error detection.Examples of IDEs are VS Code and PyCharm.
A VCS keeps a record of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary.Examples are Git and SVN.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging and fixing bugs - Use debugging tools like breakponts and log statements to trace errors.
Managing Complex codebases - Follow coding best practices such as modular programming and proper naming conventions.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - It focuses on testing individual components of the software in isolation to verify their correctness. Importance:It ensures that individual parts of the software work correctly before integration.
Integration -It verifies that different modules work together correctly after being combined. Importance: Detects issues in data flow and communication between components.     
System - It evaluates the entire software application to ensure it meets functional and non- functional requirements. Importance:Validates the system as a whole,ensuring all modules work together.
Acceptance - It determines if the software meets business needs and is ready for deployment. Importance:Ensures the software aligns with business needs and customer expectations.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to effectively interact with AI models such as LLMs.
Importance:Improves AI response quality and enhances efficiency and prductivity.
    

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt: "Tell me about cybersecurity."
Improved prompt:"Explain the importance of encryption in cybersecurity,including how it protects data and common encryption methods like AES."
This prompt is more specific and has clear objectives.
